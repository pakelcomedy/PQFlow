# üí° PQFlow Pro: Virtual Queue System ‚Äî Unified & Advanced

## üéØ Purpose

PQFlow Pro is a secure, scalable, and fully client-side virtual queue system designed for commercial use in hospitals, workshops, pharmacies, public services, and more. Users join with a simple QR code scan or link click‚Äîno apps or forms needed. Admins manage multiple branches, services, and counters via Firebase, all hosted on GitHub Pages.

## üß© Core Features

1. **Auto-Join via QR/Link**  
   - URL format:  
     ```
     https://your-domain.com/?autoJoin=true&branch=<branchId>&service=<serviceId>
     ```
   - Generates encrypted queue entry, stores in Firestore & localStorage.

2. **Encrypted Queue Data**  
   - All queue metadata (number, branch, service, timestamps) AES-encrypted client-side.

3. **Multi-Branch & Multi-Admin Support**  
   - Role-based access control (branch admins vs. superadmins).  
   - Admins see only their branch‚Äôs queues; superadmins see all.

4. **User Progress Bar**  
   - ‚ÄúYou are position 7 of 23‚Äù displayed as a dynamic progress bar.  
   - Updated in real time from Firestore‚Äôs `currentNumber`.

5. **Real-time Updates**  
   - Firestore `onSnapshot()` for instant queue status on user and admin screens.

6. **Multi-Language (EN & ID)**  
   - JSON-based strings (`lang/en.json`, `lang/id.json`).  
   - Language preference saved in localStorage; toggle in UI.

7. **Export Queue History**  
   - Admins download today‚Äôs or week‚Äôs data as CSV or JSON.  
   - Client-side JS reads Firestore, creates Blob, triggers download.

8. **Manual Check-In Mode**  
   - For walk-in customers: admin inputs name, branch, service.  
   - Entry flagged `source: "manual"` in Firestore.

9. **Offline Mode (PWA)**  
   - `manifest.json` + Workbox service worker caches assets & latest queue state.  
   - Users can view status even without internet.

10. **Branch Opening Hours**  
    - Admins set operating hours (`branches/{id}/hours`: `{ start: "08:00", end: "17:00" }`).  
    - Outside hours, users see ‚ÄúService Not Yet Open‚Äù.

11. **Smart Queue Distribution**  
    - For services with multiple counters, auto-assign next queue to the counter with fewest waiting.  
    - Uses Firestore subcollection `counters/{counterId}/queueNumbers`.

12. **Emergency / Priority Mode**  
    - Admins can flag urgent entries.  
    - Priority queues are called before regular ones.

13. **Single Queue per Device per Day**  
    - Enforced via encrypted localStorage flag & Firestore lookup.

14. **TV Mode Display**  
    - Fullscreen view showing the currently called number, customizable per branch/service.

## üß† Firestore Data Schema (Example)

```jsonc
// branches/{branchId}
{
  "name": "RS Jakarta",
  "hours": {
    "start": "08:00",
    "end": "17:00"
  }
}

// admins/{uid}
{
  "branchId": "rs-jkt",
  "role": "admin" // or "superadmin"
}

// queues/{queueId}
{
  "queueNumber": 25,
  "status": "waiting",        // waiting | called | skipped | done
  "branchId": "rs-jkt",
  "service": "general",
  "createdAt": Timestamp,
  "priority": false,
  "source": "qr",             // or "manual"
  "encryptedData": "<AES‚Ä¶>"
}

// counters/{counterId}
{
  "branchId": "rs-jkt",
  "service": "general",
  "queueNumbers": [1, 5, 9]
}
